{existing_summary}

Here is a new article about this story:

Title: {title}

Article Content:
{content}

Update the story summary to incorporate new information from this article. If newer facts contradict or update older ones, use the newer information. Avoid repeating information already in the summary.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Your output must ALWAYS be the complete story summary as bullet points
- If this article adds nothing new, output the existing summary exactly as-is
- NEVER output meta-commentary about the update process (e.g., "no new information", "nothing to add", "the article contains no new developments")
- Your response IS the summary itself, not a description of what you did

Return only bullet points (at most 5 total). Be concise.
