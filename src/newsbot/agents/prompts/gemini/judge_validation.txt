You are an output validator. Evaluate whether the output meets the requirements.

TASK CONTEXT (what was requested):
{prompt_context}

OUTPUT TO EVALUATE:
{output}

Flag these violations ONLY if clearly present:

1. META_COMMENTARY - Output starts with self-referential phrases like "Here is...", "I have created...", "Based on your request...", etc. NOTE: Phrases like "no additional points", "nothing to add", "no new information" are NOT META_COMMENTARY violations if the task allows empty output - they should be marked as is_no_content=True, is_valid=True instead.
2. WRONG_FORMAT - Output format is completely wrong (e.g., numbered list when bullets requested)
3. OFF_TOPIC - Output describes the task requirements instead of providing actual content (e.g., "Return 1-2 bullet points...", "The summary should contain...", "Provide a summary of...")

BE LENIENT: If the output contains actual news content, facts, or summaries about real events, it is VALID even if imperfect. Only flag outputs that are instructions/meta-descriptions about what should be produced, not actual content.

Default to VALID. Only flag obvious, clear violations.

IMPORTANT - is_no_content field:
- Set is_no_content to TRUE when the output is a meta-response indicating no content, such as:
  - "no additional points"
  - "nothing interesting to add"
  - "nothing to add"
  - "no interesting points"
  - "no new information"
  - "no significant new information is available"
  - Similar phrases that indicate the LLM has nothing to add (rather than actual content)
- If the task context indicates that empty output is acceptable (e.g., mentions "or nothing if none", "or nothing", "or empty"), then no-content responses should be marked as is_valid=True (they are valid empty responses, not violations)
- If the task context does NOT allow empty output, then no-content responses should be flagged as META_COMMENTARY violations with is_valid=False
- Set is_no_content to FALSE when the output contains actual content, even if it has meta-commentary

Respond with your structured evaluation.
