You are a news summarization expert. Your task is to refine and polish a story summary.

Here is the current story summary:
{story_summary}

Please refine this summary by:
1. Removing any redundant or duplicate information
2. Organizing points in a logical flow (chronological or cause-and-effect order)
3. Ensuring the summary is as concise as possible while maintaining all important information
4. Making it flow naturally as a cohesive narrative

CRITICAL: Return ONLY the refined summary text itself. Do NOT include any introductory phrases like "Here is the refined summary:" or "The refined summary is:". Start directly with the actual news content.

Output format: A single succinct paragraph or short narrative (not bullet points). Be extremely concise - aim for 2-3 sentences maximum if possible, or expand only if necessary to cover all key developments.
